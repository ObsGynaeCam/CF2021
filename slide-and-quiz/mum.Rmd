# Mum is pregnant! {data-background=images/B_preg1.png}
- The pregnancy will last approximately 9 months, which are divided into three 3-month periods, called **TRIMESTERS**.
- The baby will grow in mum’s uterus, in the lower part of her abdomen.
- During pregnancy, her uterus expands and the walls of the uterus thicken to make room and support the baby.

# First trimester (1-3 months) {data-background=images/kelly-sikkema-IE8KfewAp-w-unsplash.jpg}
- Mum might feel unwell some days, but it’s all normal: her body is adapting and changing in order to support the baby’s growth. 
- It is very important that mum attends all the recommended antenatal visits:

# Test for mum and the baby 
- Mum’s belly will be measured to check that the baby is growing as expected.
- Mum’s blood pressure will be measured to make sure it's not too high or now. 
- Mum’s pee will be tested to check that there are no dangerous substances in there.
- A special machine, called Ultrasound Scanner, will be used to see the baby inside mum’s belly and to measure his/her size.

# Second trimester (4-6 months) {data-background=images/freestocks-ux53SGpRAHU-unsplash.jpg}
- Mum’s belly is starting to grow as the baby is getting bigger.
- The baby is also starting to move.
- It’s important to pay attention to the baby’s movements.
- If they decrease or change, mum should get in touch with the midwives because the baby might be unwell.

# Third trimester (7-9 months) {data-background=images/christian-bowen-I0ItPtIsVEE-unsplash.jpg}
- Baby is maturing and getting ready to be born.
- It is fairly common for a baby to be positioned head-up in mum’s uterus, with the feet pointed towards the birth canal. 
- At the end of pregnancy he/she will automatically turn into a head-down position to prepare for birth.
- At birth, the baby is about 45-55cm long and weighs about 2.5-4.5kg.

# Good nutrition and habits (1/2)
- Mum should have a **healthy diet** to support herself and the baby.
- Food should be prepared in a clean environment; vegetables and fruits should be washed carefully; meat, fish and eggs should be cooked well. 
- Midwife/doctor’s recommendations should be followed regarding supplements in pregnancy.
- Mum should keep up her **normal daily physical activity or exercise** (e.g. sport, running, yoga, dancing, walking) for as long as she feels comfortable, but she should not exhaust herself: exercise is not dangerous for the baby!

# Good nutrition and habits (2/2)
- She should eat a variety of different foods every day to provide the right balance of nutrients that she and the baby need, including:
    - at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables.
    - starchy foods (bread, potatoes, breakfast cereals, rice, pasta, noodles, oats) as they are an important source of energy.
    - protein-rich foods (beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat, poultry, nuts).
    - dairy foods (milk, cheese and yoghurt) as they contain calcium and other important nutrients.

# What food and habits to avoid during pregnancy
- Mum should avoid foods that are high in fat, sugar or both (all spreading fats such as butter, oils, salad dressings, cream, chocolate and sweets, crisps, fizzy drinks)
- She shouldn’t eat raw fish (such as in sushi) 
- She should avoid drinking coffee and alcohol, smoking and using illicit drugs for the sake of her own and the baby’s health
