# What is gestation? {data-background=images/B_preg1.png}
- Gestation is the period of time between conception and birth when a baby grows and develops inside the mother’s womb.
- A normal gestation lasts 37 to 42 weeks.
- Gestational age is measured (in weeks) from the first day of mum’s last menstrual cycle. 
- During weeks 1 and 2, a woman is not yet pregnant (her body is preparing for a pregnancy).

# Fertilisation (or conception) {data-background=images/B_wk2.png}
- At the end of week 2, an egg is released from an ovary. During intercourse, sperm enters the vagina, then travels through the uterus into the fallopian tubes. 
- Usually, a single sperm enters the egg (fertilization). 
- The combined sperm and egg (zygote) contains all the genetic information (DNA) needed to form a baby (half from mother’s egg, half from father’s sperm).

# First trimester<br>(3-12 weeks) {data-background=images/kelly-sikkema-IE8KfewAp-w-unsplash.jpg}
So, you’re pregnant - congratulations! <br>

## Week 3 {data-background=images/B_wk3.png}
- The zygote multiplies into a ball of cells (blastocyst) while it travels down the fallopian tube. 
- Once the blastocyst reaches the uterus, it buries itself into the womb (implantation).

## What are twin babies? {data-background=images/B_twin_baby.png}
- Identical twins happen when one fertilised embryo splits into two. 
- They have same sex, same genes and look very alike.
- Non-identical twins happen when two eggs are fertilised by two sperm at the same time. 
- They do not have same genes or appearance and may be of different sex.

## Week 4-6 {data-background=images/B_wk6.png}
- Week 4: the ball of cells is now officially a human embryo.
    - A pregnant woman is now able to get a positive result on a home pregnancy test.
    - The baby is the size of a poppy seed.
- Week 5: the circulatory system is beginning to form, and the tiny "heart" will start to beat this week.
    - The baby is the size of a sesame seed.
- Week 6: the kidney, intestines and brain are beginning to develop.
    - The baby has a tail and is the size of a lentil.

## Week 7-12 {data-background=images/B_wk10.png}
- Week 7: the arms and legs are starting to form.
    - The baby is the size of a blueberry.
- Week 8: the lungs are starting to develop.
    - The baby is the size of a kidney bean.
- Weeks 9–12: all baby’s organs are in place.
- From week 10 until birth, the baby is called a fetus.

# Second trimester<br>(13-27 weeks) {data-background=images/freestocks-ux53SGpRAHU-unsplash.jpg}

## Can I find out the sex of my baby? {data-background=images/B_baby_sex.png}
- You usually can during your second routine ultrasound scan (18 to 21 weeks of pregnancy).
- The sonographer will not be able to be 100% certain about your baby's sex.
- You can also find out the sex of your baby using genetic tests.
