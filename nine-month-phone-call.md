> Have a go at colouring these pages while you learn more about the placenta and how it connects the mum and baby through our [video](#video) and [colouring papers](#colouring). The activity is suitable for younger children who already know where babies come from, but doesnâ€™t require any detailed biological knowledge.)

> The placenta is a very important organ, yet often overlooked. At the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, we do research on the biology and the function of the placenta. We also conduct large population studies which aim at identifying key features that could predict problems in pregnancy. Our ultimate goal is to find better ways of helping mums to stay healthy during pregnancy and to give birth to healthy babies.
