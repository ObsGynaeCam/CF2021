> Hello! 
> We are scientists from the [Department of Obs & Gynae](https://www.obgyn.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and we run an online event for [Cambridge Festival](https://www.sciencefestival.cam.ac.uk/). 

# Description

</p>

Learn about the key players in a healthy pregnancy: the mum, the baby and the placenta. Discuss the latest research at the [Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology](https://www.obgyn.cam.ac.uk/) and understand the role of the placenta through interactive hands-on activities.

[Placenta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta) is a very important organ, yet often overlooked. At our interactive display you can learn how the placenta looks like and what jobs it performs. Kids and parents can have a go at a placenta maze game or model the placenta out of play dough. You will also have an opportunity to learn interactively about healthy diet and lifestyle during pregnancy and about antenatal care and the baby’s development. We will demonstrate the assessment of fetal growth using various methods and you will have a chance to examine ultrasound images of babies.

At the [Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology](https://www.obgyn.cam.ac.uk/), we do research on the biology and the function of the placenta. We also conduct large population studies which aim at identifying key features that could predict problems in pregnancy. Our ultimate goal is to find better ways of helping mums to give birth to healthy babies.

# Hands on activities
> Have a go at colouring these pages while you learn more about the placenta and how it connects the mum and baby through our [video](https://obsgynaecam.github.io/CF2021/handson1.html). The activity is suitable for younger children who already know where babies come from, but doesn’t require any detailed biological knowledge.)
